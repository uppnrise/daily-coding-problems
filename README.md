# Daily Coding Problems Repository

A collection of daily coding problems and their solutions, primarily focused on problems from [dailycodingproblem.com](https://dailycodingproblem.com) and other competitive programming platforms.

## 🎯 Goal
Solve one coding problem daily to improve algorithmic thinking and programming skills. Solutions are organized by difficulty level and include detailed explanations.

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
src/main/java/com/dailyproblems/
├── easy/          # Easy difficulty problems
├── medium/        # Medium difficulty problems
└── hard/          # Hard difficulty problems
```

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Java 11 or higher
- VS Code with Java Extension Pack (recommended)

### Running Solutions

1. **Using VS Code:**
   - Open the project in VS Code
   - Navigate to any solution file
   - Use `Ctrl+F5` (or `Cmd+F5` on Mac) to run without debugging
   - Or use `F5` to run with debugging

2. **Using Command Line:**
   ```bash
   # Compile a specific solution
   javac src/main/java/com/dailyproblems/easy/ProblemName.java
   
   # Run the compiled solution
   java -cp src/main/java com.dailyproblems.easy.ProblemName
   ```

3. **Using Java Extension in VS Code:**
   - Click the "Run" button that appears above the main method
   - Or use the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and search for "Java: Run"

## 📝 Solution Format

Each solution follows this structure:

```java
/**
 * Problem: [Problem Title]
 * 
 * Problem Statement:
 * [Detailed problem description]
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: [example input]
 * Output: [example output]
 * 
 * Approach:
 * [Explanation of the solution approach]
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(...)
 * Space Complexity: O(...)
 */
public class ProblemName {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test cases and example usage
    }
    
    // Solution methods with detailed comments
}
```
